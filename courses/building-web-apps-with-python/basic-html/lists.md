# Lists
We make all kinds of lists in our regular life. Adding lists in the HTML document is very easy.

## Let add a List

We usually start a list by `<ol>` and end it by `</ol>`. Each item in the list is surrounded by `<li>` and `</li>`.


So for example metros of India list will have

```html
<ol>
    <li>Delhi</li>
    <li>Mumbai</li>
    <li>Kolkatta </li>
    <li>Chennai</li>
</ol>
```

This produced a numbered list with automatic numbering. This is called `ordered list` aka `ol`. As you can see each item inside the list is surrounded by `li` aka `list item` tag.

We can also do just a bulleted list

## How to unordered list
By just changing the `ol` with 'ul'. Its called `unordered list`.

```html
<ul>
    <li>Delhi</li>
    <li>Mumbai</li>
    <li>Kolkatta </li>
    <li>Chennai</li>
</ul>
```

## What more
You can also format the text inside the list items. You can also add other tags inside these.
