short_introduction: Learn how to implement static type checking in Python
description: |
  It should be no surprise that Python is a dynamically typed language. And
  indeed, having dynamic types in your code is one of the best features of
  Python. But dynamic types has its own problems as well, as it takes away a
  great feature that statically typed languages like C++ and Java provide: You
  can't accidentally pass the wrong types in them. If you pass an integer where
  a string is expected in Java, your code won't compile. But in Python, your
  code will start just fine, until it crashes with a TypeError while running.
  Wouldn't it be great, if you could optionally write types in Python, to get
  the same type checking guarantees that statically typed languages have? Mypy
  lets you do exactly that!

  Mypy is Python's official type checker. It's a really valuable and mature tool
  that interacts seamlessly with Python, to provide really powerful features
  like type safety, null safety, static duck typing, and generics, allowing you
  to have your Python code checked with a solid type system.

  Mypy Primer will take you from knowing nothing about mypy, to being able to
  skillfully implement static type checking in your projects.
